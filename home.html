        <h2>Who is the Batman?</h2>
        <p><strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>, the owner of Wayne Enterprises, developed the persona of <strong>Batman</strong> in order to fight crime in Gotham City, having sworn vengeance against the city's criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents as a child. Wayne does not possess any inhuman superpowers, instead relying on martial arts training, powerful intellect, and a large arsenal of weapons and equipment afforded to him by his vast wealth.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I must have a disguise. Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot. So my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...a...a...a bat!"</p>
            <cite>-- Bruce Wayne, <em>Detective Comics #33.</em></cite>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Who are Batman's allies?</h3>
        <p>Batman is assisted in his fight against crime in Gotham City by many allies, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alfred Pennyworth</strong>, Bruce Wayne's butler, one of the few people who knows the true identity of Batman. He is the only other resident of Wayne's residence, Wayne Manor, and acts as a kind of father figure to Bruce Wayne.</li>
            <li><strong>Lucius Fox</strong>, Bruce Wayne's business manager and technology specialist who is responsible for developing equipment for Batman.</li>
            <li><strong>Commissioner James 'Jim' Gordon</strong> of the Gotham City Police Department, Batman's closest ally in the GCPD who is unaware of his true identity and skeptical of vigilantism, but believes that Gotham needs Batman. His daughter Barbara Gordon is also an ally of Batman, fighting crime under the vigilante persona <strong>Batgirl</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Robin</strong>, Batman's sidekick and protégé.</li>
            <li><strong>The Justice League</strong>, a team of fellow superheroes including <strong>Superman</strong>, <strong>Wonder Woman</strong>, <strong>The Flash</strong>, and others.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Who are Batman's adversaries?</h3>
        <p>Batman's long fight against the criminal elements of Gotham have led him into conflict with a number of villanous foes, the most significant of which include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Joker</strong>, a psychopathic criminal mastermind of mysterious origins, the Joker is obsessed with Batman and represents everything that Batman is not. His colourful appearance and attire, and his theatrical manner, contrast with that of Batman, as does his tendency to murder on a whim. The Joker frequently attempts to force Batman to kill, to prove that anybody can become a monster, even a hero.</li>
            <li><strong>The Penguin</strong>, the persona of Oswald Cobblepot, a powerful figure in Gotham's criminal underworld and owner of the Iceberg Lounge nightclub. Unlike the Joker, the Penguin is completely sane, and has aspirations of acquiring wealth, power and the respect of Gotham's elite. The Penguin is also obsessed with birds and frequently sets out to steal valuable bird-related items.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Face</strong>, the criminal persona of former district attorney Harvey Dent. Dent was previously an ally of Batman and a force for good in Gotham, however an acid attack during a court trial leaves him hideously scarred and he subsequently loses his mind. He develops an obsession with duality, making important decisions by the toss of a coin, and staging crimes based around the number 2.</li>
            <li><strong>Catwoman</strong>, the persona of Selina Kyle, a prolific burglar in Gotham. Catwoman is a skilled gymnast and combatant, and despite her villanous origins has frequently worked together with Batman, even developing a love-hate romantic relationship with him. She often appears as an antiheroine, doing dishonest things with honest motivations.</li>
            <li><strong>Bane</strong>, a powerful masked mercenary and terrorist possessing superhuman strength. Bane uses the drug venom to acquire his superhuman strength and immense physicality, and he is also a superintelligent tactician and skilled martial artist.</li>
            <li><strong>Harley Quinn</strong>, formerly the Arkham Asylum psychologist Harleen Quinzel. Quinzel was assigned to treat the Joker and eventually fell in love with the criminal mastermind, becoming an accomplice to his crimes. She adopted a similar persona to the Joker, that of Harley Quinn, and may be considered as the 'Robin' to the Joker's 'Batman'.</li>
            <li><strong>The Riddler</strong>, an intelligent criminal mastermind who is known for incorporating complex riddles, traps and puzzles into his criminal schemes. Riddler is also an accomplished computer programmer, engineer and escape artist.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
